# COMPX304-Lab-9
Small bit of a code I wrote for a lab on Virtual File Systems and Authorization

# Assignment Spec
Write and test a program in C that recursively scans all directories contained in the directory its run in and prints on the screen
- (a) all files that others can read or execute and were created within the last 6 months.
- (b) all directories that others can execute and have been modified within the last year.

After you do this, consider using “chmod” to change permissions for information you consider sensitive; or at your leisure, expand your application to change permissions directly in C.
